This is a collection of tools to test the NCAR RDA's experimental OPeNDAP server.  I am trying to provide a diverse set of tools for internal testing and eventually this may be an area that RDA users can get code ideas for their own uses.

Please note that to run any of the code in this repo 'as is', you will need to be a registered user of the NCAR RDA <http://rda.ucar.edu>
