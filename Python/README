This is a collection of python (2.7) tools to test the NCAR RDA experimental OPeNDAP access run via THREDDS Data Server.

Programs found here were developed using Anaconda Python distribution (http://continuum.io/) but should work on yellowstone if the user loads the python module as well as the all-python-libs module.  Note: you will need to enable X Forwarding to display graphics.

Each tool will implement python's argparse class, so running the program with a '-h' will provide usage information.

Please note that I will try to include only running programs, but occasionally I may push some half-working code.

Please see the README in the NCARDAPTestingSuite (parent directory to this one) for a general overview of tools

Don't hesitate to report a bug or issue.
