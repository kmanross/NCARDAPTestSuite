This is a collection of [NASA Panoply] tools to test the NCAR RDA experimental OPeNDAP access run via THREDDS Data Server.

For more information on Panoply, see http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/

***NOTE***
Versions 3.1.6 and 3.1.8 of Panoply require the user to enter their credentials numerous times (at least 5 and often closer to a dozen) to get the data.  I don't know why this is, and perhaps if I were more patient it might be fine.  Version 3.1.8 throws an authentication error when trying to plot a variable and then fails.  I recommend 3.1.6 if you can find it.  Even then, you will need to be patient.  Also, Panoply has no batch mode.

Panoply is built on netcdf-Java, so it has the same core as the IDV and tools-UI, as well as ncBrowse.  I would suggest that you try this tool only if you are really married to Panoply.

for tutorial on opening remote data.  Haven't got the catalog feature to work yet.

Please see the README in the NCARDAPTestingSuite (parent directory to this one) for a general overview of tools
