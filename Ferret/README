This is a collection of [LAS Ferret] tools to test the NCAR RDA experimental OPeNDAP access run via THREDDS Data Server.

See http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/home for more information on LAS Ferret

Requirements:

Ferret installed on server.  For internal NCAR users, this is available on yellowstone as a module.  Will require X Forwarding.

Steps for yellowstone users:

0) copy ferret script to yellowstone

1) Log into yellowstone with X forwarding. (I have also used -Y in place of -X)
   ssh -X username@yellowstone.ucar.edu

2) Load ferret module:
   load module ferret

3) Modify script to include YOUR username and password. Don't forget to replace the
   @ in your username/email with %40 (but leave the second @ symbol prepended to the 
   server):
   manross@ucar.edu:mypassword -> manross%40ucar.edu:mypassword

4) Run script:
   ferret -script ferret_script.jnl


Please see the README in the NCARDAPTestingSuite (parent directory to this one) for a general overview of tools

Don't hesitate to report a bug or issue.
