This is a collection of [MATLAB] tools to test the NCAR RDA experimental OPeNDAP access run via THREDDS Data Server.

It turns out that MATLAB does not handle authentication for OPeNDAP.  See:

Please see the README in the NCARDAPTestingSuite (parent directory to this one) for a general overview of tools

Don't hesitate to report a bug or issue.
