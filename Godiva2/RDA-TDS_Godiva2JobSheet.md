Hopefully what follows is a coherent procedure for playing around with (I mean "testing") the Godiva2 viewer configured with the NCAR RDA's experimental THREDDS http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/ which is at:

(Note: requires a subscription which can be found at https://rda.ucar.edu/index.html?hash=data_user&action=register)

__First step__: Be sure you have an RDA account.  If you have already used the NCAR RDA (formerly known as DSS), and your account is still active, then you should be good to go!

__Next__: Go to the RDA THREDDS Data Server (TDS) at http://castle.ucar.edu/thredds/  You will be asked for your RDA username and password.  _(Your credentials may fail upon the first few attempts. I am looking for the source of this error. It should accept your login after 3-5 attempts.)_

__Then__: click on the "Best Timeseries" for the ds083.2 dataset

__After__: clicking on the Best Timeseries link, you will find a link near the bottom of the page for the Godiva2 viewer.  This will allow you to peruse the available data as images and even allow some rudimentary sampling.  (But I'm getting ahead of myself).
