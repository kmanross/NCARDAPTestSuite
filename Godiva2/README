This is a collection of [WMS/WCS Godiva2 Viewer] tools to test the NCAR RDA experimental OPeNDAP access run via THREDDS Data Server.

For more information about Godiva2 Viewer, please see http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk/trac/ncWMS/wiki/GodivaTwoUserGuide

TODO: develop and commit a job sheet for sample steps for viewing and examining the data.
